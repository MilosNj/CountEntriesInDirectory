# Count Entries In Directory
Simple NodeJS app for counting entries in a directory (non recursively).

## How to run the app
After cloning the repo run `npm i` to install the yargs package.
Then start a console window and change directory to the repo directory.
Then run `npm bin/main.js -d {full directory name}`
The result will be the number of files and directories inside the given directory, shown in the console window.
